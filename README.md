# xsibackup
Standalone backup of VMWare ESXi vSphere 5.X virtual machines to another datastore or differential over network. No agents, self capable, runs directly in the hypervisor host, ESXi 5.1, ESXi 5.5 &amp; ESXi 6.0 compatible, hot backups.

Author forbids distribution of modified code, so I've removed it from Git since I'll be liable if anyone downloads my fork

It's a good script, very useful, and I'd like to contribute but I can do without the hassle tbh

Please refer back to the 33hops repo
